## Convolutional Neural Networks

## Project: Write an Algorithm for a Dog Identification App 

Installations: To read the documents you must have Jupyter Notebook installed. In addition have been used the fallowing Python packages: 
- numpy, 
- sklearn, 
- keras,
- matplotlib

Project Motivation:

Write an algorithm that could be used as part of a mobile or web app to detect and estimate of the dog's breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.

Insights:

- In this kind of model the measure selected was accuracy because is a metric that measures how often a machine learning model correctly predicts the outcome.
- Another important conclusion is a well know one, wituh more train we would have better resultas.
- With much more time and resources we can use data augmentation to improve our model.
- Above we demonstrated that adding more layers to the trained CNN algorithm will help improve accuracy but this process is time consuming.
