## Project: Write an Algorithm for a Dog Identification App 

Installations: To read the documents you must have Jupyter Notebook installed. In addition have been used the fallowing Python packages: 
- numpy, 
- sklearn, 
- keras,
- matplotlib

Project Motivation:

Write an algorithm that could be used as part of a mobile or web app to detect and estimate of the dog's breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.

Some Insights:

- In this kind of model the measure selected was accuracy because is a metric that measures how often a machine learning model correctly predicts the outcome.
- Another important conclusion is a well know one, with more train data we would have better results.
- With much more time and resources we can use data augmentation to improve our model.

The Result is in my Medium post:https://medium.com/@guille.can87/what-kind-of-dog-do-you-look-like-785bbb5dc8d3

File Descriptions:

- dog_app.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with all the impoted data and code to run model.
- haarcascades/: Folder containing export of Haar featurebased cascade classifiers to import.
- images/: Set of images used in the jupyter notebook and Medium post article.
